## Personal website to host github pages
>Using Boostrap 4 Github Pages, HTML, and Markdown 

Personal website will be able to host my projects, and I will be able to link anything I think is important to me. The bootstrap 4 framework really helps will the layout and makes sure the website can adjust for other devices. It also allowed me to learn some html to make any edits I needed and change to my preference. The markdown formatting is also used in the rmd files within R-Studio so being familiar with markdown helped.

Links for my certifications as well as organizations I am a part of are available.

I am a fan of anagrams and thus: *corks often withered*
